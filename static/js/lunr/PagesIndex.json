var data = [{"title":"About","href":"page/about","content":" Goals of this Library This Library is intended to be a wealth of knowledge on product Discovery and Delivery practices to be adopted and evolved by a positive engaged and supportive global community While this is intended for everyone who has an interest in learning more about the practices used by teams on a continuous journey of discovery and delivery building applications this Open Practice Library has two main use cases in mind Share the Big Picture Describe how people in this community use practices to accomplish engagement success Learn how practices fit with each other and the way that we take individual practices to create seamless engagement delivery Search with Intent Share details about a particular practice that community members use learn perspectives on a particular practice and why practices are used pointers on how to facilitate it and when it should be employed What This Library Is Just enough information for each practice to specify the end state its purpose and the minimum possible constraints in order to create alignment and enable autonomy for participants and facilitators Where more detailed content is useful well provide links This idea comes from Donald Reinerstens Principle of Mission which provides the conceptual foundation to Lean Enterprise by Jez Humble Joanne Molesky Barry OReilly Contributing Wed love to hear your thoughts about the material presented here or other content youd like to add Open an issuehttpsgithubcomopenpracticelibraryopenpracticelibraryissues and we can go from there Alternately feel free to fork our github repohttpsgithubcomopenpracticelibraryopenpracticelibrary and submit a PR of your proposed changes We use markdown files for our base content that gets rendered for this site For helpful development setup see our READMEhttpsgithubcomopenpracticelibraryopenpracticelibraryblobmasterREADMEmd Style Were looking to be friendly and also authoritative comprehensive and also concise We use the active voice where possible to help guide teams to action We dont always get it right though If you find something that could be clearer or punchier feel free to send us a merge request How to Fit These Practices into Your Existing Approach While everybody has their approach to engagements there is a need to identify particular outcomes that common practices look to accomplish So the Open Practice Library has placed each practice on a visual canvas that includes the Mobius Loophttpwwwmobiusloopcom and a foundation layer Mobius is an open source model created by Gabrielle Benefield and Ryan Shriver Mobius is an open source model created by the Outcome Deliveryhttpwwwoutcomedeliverycom community libraryloopimageslooplabelspathsvg Practices are identified on one of areas of the canvas 1 The Why area of the Discovery Loop Why practices help describe purpose Why are we doing this What is the problem we need to solve or idea to pursue Who are our target customers and what do they need 2 The Outcomes area of the Discovery Loop Practices about Outcomes help establish where we want to get to and how we will measure the customer and business needs are delivered What are our objectives and deliverables 3 The Options Practices in the Options area help define what to work on first and what is enough Delivery before going to Discovery to define the next set of outcomes What is the priority order of work items Did we met our outcomes based on the deliverables Did we disprove an outcome based on the deliverables 4 The Deliver area of the Delivery Loop Deliver practices help establish how we run experiments and deliver solutions to stakeholders and users 5 The Measure Learn area of the Delivery Loop Measure is where we assess what really happened Did we deliver a desired outcome How much of an impact did we really make How well did we do with the way we worked Learn is the feedback loop that takes us back to the options pivot This is where we learn what to do next 6 The Culture Collaboration area of the Foundation layer Culture practices help provide the environment establish team relationships mindset and engagement to facilitate a smooth and continuous journey round Discovery and Delivery loops Collaboration practices help facilitate conversation and alignment in a transparent and open manner facilitating successful Discovery and Delivery practices to be effective 7 The Technical area of the Foundation layer Technical practices enable the successful continuous and sustainable delivery of

introduced in a blog by Alberto Brandolini1footnote1 in 2013 At the end of the event storm you should have A shared understand of the business process you are building as part of the project including which steps should be considered in scope and which steps are out of scope the users involved in the process an initial inventory of UI screens for the process an initial inventory of Aggregates2footnote2 A physical diagram with the above information which can be transferred to a digital format Why use Event Storming It is significantly faster and a heck of a lot more fun than traditional process modeling techniques Youll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period The technique is iterative which allows facilitators to slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants pick and choose participants by session provide cognitive breaks participants will get tired It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain

planning technique It was introduced by Gojko Adzic in 2012 At the end of the impact map you should have A shared understand of your efforts goal or problem statement An inventory of human behavioral changes that must occur or not occur for your project to be successful These are the impact from which the technique gets it name Optionally an inventory of project scope that could be delivered to achieve the aforementioned impacts Some sort of prioritization of scope andor impacts A physical or digital diagram with the above information Why use Impact Mapping Most planning activities revolve around juggling a shopping list of features as Gojko calls them Even though the features are delivered often the business objective is not achieved Impact Mapping reorients us towards delivering value not delivering features Impact Mapping introduces a very simple human centered design process and as such it is a great way to put lightweight design thinking techniques into practice Its a graphical mind map which reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators alike The technique is highly adaptable because the core mind map is so simple Gojkos original text describes a 4 week executive level strategic planning workshop It can also be run in a 46 hour session with Project Sponsors in the early stages of product development planning These are just two of endless possible variations of the technique Related Practices Start At The Endpracticestartattheend is another practice which leads to the same outputs Compared to Start At The End Impact Mapping produces a higher

rather simple exercise which asks participants to describe what success looks like for their work and use this to define the goal of the effort We default to 12 months but it can be longer or shorter Then the exercise asks participants to imagine all the ways their project can fail and using the results to enumerate key questions or assumptions that must be examined at the start of the work The technique is derived from Chapter 4 of The Sprint Book1footnote1 At the end of the exercise you will have A shared understand of your efforts goal A list of key questions or assumptions that need to

Mapping","href":"practice/user-story-mapping","content":" What is it User Story Mapping is an evolution of the traditional Agile backlog made popular by Jeff Patton in 20081footnote1 Its an effective practice for creating lightweight release plans that can drive standard Agile delivery practices At the end of user story mapping you should have A backlog of scope items captured as stories or simply feature titles the team believes can be delivered in the planning window This means some items will be placed out of scope The backlog sliced into 3 iterations such that it forms the outline of plan Enough detail in the first iteration of the plan to get started with the work Why use User Story Mapping No one likes estimating work effort but its an important step in many environments User Story Mapping presents an approach to estimation that many teams find much more tolerable than practices like planning poker or tshirt sizing Many projects have a natural progression of work from beginning middle to end This progression is often lost in a traditional flat backlog User Story Mapping captures this information with a lightweight mechanism to plan out more than one iteration ie an Agile release plan User Story Mapping presents backlog items in the context of the overall business process so you dont lose sight of the big picture a common pitfall in Scrum projects Related Practices

and visually representing all aspects of work Information that is useful to team members stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls windows doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information The Information Radiator is an artefact that is used to physically provide information to one or more people The activity of Walking the Walls is where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated teams are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations Why Visualise work Visualising work helps facilitate a transparent and open way of working It helps avoid hiding information about status progress direction challenges and opportunities related to a product Traditionally such information is held in files on shared drives for example spreadsheets of project plans powerpoint slides word documents etc which has the challenge of not being accessible or known about and if found not being uptodate Where important information is constantly accessible and visible to people both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information It is also more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of

Easy How does it fit Tyipcally done in the Culture and Collaboration are of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library Facilitation Materials Needed Flip chart paper Magic Whiteboard charts Writable walls Flip chart and white board pens Stickie notes all shapes sizes and colors Sharpie pens Large monitor TV screens Small computers to radiate dashboards eg CICD monitors How To Consider the positioning of all information radiators and who will have line of sight Consider use of color coding across different information radiators for example same color stickies to represent features Allow sufficient time to produce high quality information radiators that will inspire and drive interest Introduce the information radiator to all those who will use it either in contributing to it andor consuming information from it Encourage continuous inspection and update to the information presented Visualisation of Workimagesvisualisationofwork2png External References 1 Information Radiator by

Mapping (VSM) and Metrics-Based Process Mapping (MBPM)","href":"practice/vsm-and-mbpm","content":" What is it Value Stream Mapping VSM and MetricsBased Process Mapping MBPM are third generation lean process improvement techniques optimized for an extended organizational transformation effort They work in tandem where VSM is designed to view the big macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives and MBPM is designed to view the detailed micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyotas information and material flow as documented in Lean Thinking1footnote1 and the second generation from Learning to See2footnote2 Why use VSM MBPM In the context of software delivery VSM MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize brownfield delivery processes including everything from requirements definition infrastructure provisioning and application development Being derived from Lean Manufacturing VSM MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization at both a macro and micro level from the time a customer requests a goodservice until the time a customer receives the goodservice When used together these tools are particularly effective at building shared understand throughout the various levels of an organization how work is actually done creating the urgency for improvement formulating specific data driven improvement plans preventing improvement work in a particular area that leads to suboptimization for the entire value stream process Who do you need No more than 10 people VSM requires decision makers usually Director or above MBPM requires front line workers for the processes being improved Suggested Time Done as documented by Karen Martin these are 23 day dedicated workshops Difficulty Facilitator Hard Participants Medium to Hard Facilitation Materials Needed Some teams prefer whiteboards but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts Drawing paper roll3footnote3 Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes4footnote4 markers for the PostIts charcoal pencil and eraser5footnote5 to draw lines between PostIts For MBPM chalk line can be useful but not required How does it fit Both VSM MBPM document a current state map and then design a future state map for subsequent implementation The current state map is typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library The future state map is typically done as part of the Outcomes area of the Discoery of the Open Practice Library Additional
