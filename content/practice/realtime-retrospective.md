# Realtime Retrospective

## What is it?

The Realtime Retrospective technique was created by Emily Webber[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) in the UK. This is a great way to capture feedback from a large number of participants in realtime over an extended period of time. By the middle/end of the Realtime Retrospective you should have:

- Feedback in a timeline like fashion that are both positive and negative things
- A capture of the mood and reaction of people over the course of time in a realtime manner
- Lots of sticky notes on a wall

## How does it fit

- Typically done in the Culture and Collaboration area of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library

## Why use Realtime Retrospective?

- Let's face it, nobody *likes* filling out surveys, especially if it's more than 3 questions. Why not have them write unfiltered, uncensored, and quick feedback at the time they think of it? Realtime Retrospectives provide a low bar of entry and is voluntary and easy to participate anonymously.
- For long running days or weeks with multiple sessions/activities, you can visibly see people's moods or grasp of the information in realtime
- When running similar sessions in quick succession, you may need to improve quickly and sometimes adjust on the fly.

## Who do you need?

- "Facilitator" (Person to setup/cleanup)
- People (anybody that was there during the timeframe)

## Suggested Time

- ~10 Minutes setting up and cleaning up
- Wall is kept up over the course of 1-5 days for active participation

## Difficulty
- Facilitator: Easy
- Participants: Easy

## Facilitation Materials Needed
- Drawing paper roll[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise
- 8x6 sticky notes[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5)
- At least 3 different colors of small 3x3 square sticky notes[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)
- Markers
- Painters Tape

#### Prep
- Find a wall or surface that is long enough to handle the amount of feedback you are expecting.
- Make a long line to represent time
- Draw a Happy Face above the line, a Sad Face below the line, and a surprised face along the line. (This represents the type of feedback that you wish to receive (Positive, Negative, Surprised))

#### Step 1
Explain to your participants your goal of using this practice and how to use your prepped area. Key things to share:

- Where to find materials for them to contribute
- How the timelapse begins at the left and continues until the timeframe you designate as the end.
- Any and all feedback is welcome, 1 post-it per feedback item

#### Step 2
Cycle back constantly to review your feedback and make improvements based on them as appropriate.

## Related Practices

- Timeline Retrospectives by Patrick Kua[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) uses a similar approach to gathering feedback in a sequential order
- Linda Rising has a concept of the Continuous Retrospective[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) that uses the timeline aspect of the Timeline Retrospective and to reflect on it everyday as a team.
