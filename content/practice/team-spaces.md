# What is it?

Purpose: This article contains a collection of best practices and lessons learned from real facilities build-out of global, permanent labs facilities, as well as some experiences with temporary ‘pop-up’ team spaces. 

The information is gathered from multiple sources and there may be some overlap until we consolidate some of our older material.



# Why use it?

Every team needs a place to gather and collaborate.
